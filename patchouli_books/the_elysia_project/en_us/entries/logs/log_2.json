At the same time, Elysian User Interface is in heavy development. there will be two separate interfaces: one is 'Personal Interface', "

We can't simulate a real world due to performance, so we split the world in cubes that is one meter in length, width and height, and use these cubes as basic units to calculate things. We use cubes to generate realistic terrain and buildings. All players and animals are stored as 'Entities', and we simplify their model into cubes to lower the energy consumption even more."
