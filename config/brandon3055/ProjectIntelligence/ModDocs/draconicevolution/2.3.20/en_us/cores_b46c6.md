Cores are a key crafting component in almost all Draconic Evolution recipes.
Cores come in 4 tiers Draconic (aka basic) being the lowest and Chaotic being the highest tier. The core tier used in a crafting recipe depends on the tier of the item being crafted.

As well as the 4 regular cores there are also 2 types of Energy Core. These are primarily used to craft anything that stores energy such as the tools.

Also note you can right click a vanilla spawner with any of the normal cores to create a §link[draconicevolution:stabilized_spawner]{alt_text:"Stabilized Spawner"}.
