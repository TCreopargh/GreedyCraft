The bound dislocator is a special type of dislocator that allows teleportation between dynamic end points.

This dislocator has 2 variants Point to Point and Player. Point to Point as the name suggests allows you to teleport between 2 points. When you create a point to point dislocator you first have to right click it to split it into a bound pair. You can use ether dislocator to teleport to the other. This works if the bound dislocator is in a pedestal, portal, in a players inventory or even on the ground as an item entity. This dislocator can be especially useful for things like frame quarries because it allows you to have a dislocator bound to your quarry.

As for the player type dislocator. Right clicking this dislocator will bind it to yourself. Another player or entity can then use that dislocator to teleport to your location as long as you are online.
