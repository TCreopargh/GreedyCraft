##### §nFusion Upgrades§n

Using the fusion crafting system it is possible to upgrade your tools and weapons.
To do this you will need an upgrade key for the upgrade you want 
and the required ingredients for the upgrade level you want to apply.

Most upgrades have 4 tiers. Basic, Wyvern, Draconic, and Chaotic (Note: chaotic cannot yet be applied to any items)
You must have the previous tier applied before you can apply a higher tier upgrade.

Each upgrade tier requires different ingredients and its respective tier fusion crafter.
To find the ingredients required for an upgrade key, simply hover over the key in your inventory and hold shift.
You will see a list of all ingredients required. It will cycle through the tiers every 5 seconds.
To pause the display, simply hold CTRL as well. Try it on some of the keys below.
